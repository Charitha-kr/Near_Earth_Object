# 🌍 Near-Earth Object (NEO) Orbit Visualization

This project is a **3D visualization tool** for tracking and analyzing **Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)** using publicly available orbital data. The goal is to model the orbits, speeds, and proximity of these objects to Earth to better understand potential threats and their behavior in space.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🌐 **3D Orbital Visualization** using libraries like **Three.js** or **matplotlib** (depending on frontend/backend design)
* 🛰️ **Accurate modeling of asteroid orbits** based on NASA/JPL datasets
* 📊 Real-time data rendering of speed, distance, and trajectory
* 📅 Timeline controls to visualize movement across time
* 🌌 Zoom and pan functionality for immersive space exploration
